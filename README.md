# CUSTMR

A peer-to-peer open source invoicing application for Android based systems and smartphones. This is a 100% decentralized solution to accepting lightning tips / payments as long as the host has a functional LND node on the backend.This repository only consists of some graphical design elements for sharing and feedback. Basic functional GUI is running but I underestimated the amount of backend when programming a Bitcoin Lightning wallet with node interconnectivity. I'll get back to this project eventually.
